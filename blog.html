            <p class="font-bold">Discuss the scope of var,let, and const</p>
            <p> var is a global scope. Variable declare with var are
                hoisted to
                the top of the containing function or global scope,
                which mean you can use them before they are declared.
                var can be reassigned and updated. Developer should not use the var anymore instead they can use let or
                const.
            </p> let has block-level scope, which means it is scoped to the nearest enclosing block. A block in
            JavaScript involves opening and closing curly braces. let variables that can be reassigned another value.
            <p>
                <span class="font-semibold text-lg">const:</span> const also has block-level scope, similar to let.
                Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned. They are constant and must be assigned a value when
                declared
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="font-semibold text-lg">null:</span> null is an assigned value. It means nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="font-semibold text-lg">undefined:</span> undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.

            <p>

To complete a variety of activities, the majority of business applications must exchange data with other internal and external programs.
